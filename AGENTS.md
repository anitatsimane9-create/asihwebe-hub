## Project architecture

- Keep approved organisational content in `src/lib/site-content.ts` and render it through reusable site sections so programme, pathway, partner and leadership updates stay consistent across pages.
- Keep Phakama support as a non-transactional QR placeholder until Asihwebe supplies the approved account destination; the website must not simulate or claim payment processing.
- Use the supplied Asihwebe lockup throughout shared navigation and footer branding, with the derived square mark reserved for the browser icon.
